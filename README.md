# OSM-RouteXL

OSM-RouteXL is bright and light style for OpenStreetMap. It's based on [OSM Bright][] and inspired by [Pandonia][] and [Blossom][]. The style is written in the [Carto][] language.

[OSM Bright]: https://github.com/mapbox/osm-bright
[Blossom]: https://github.com/stekhn/blossom
[Pandonia]: https://github.com/flickr/Pandonia
[Carto]: http://github.com/mapbox/carto/

This map style is mostly white and light grey, to put the focus on the content you wish to display on the map, e.g. roadtrips or routes for deliveries, collections and services. For a live setup see our [multi stop route planner](https://www.routexl.com)

## Setup

1. Get and install OSM Bright
